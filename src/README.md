# index.ts

1.  Import Statements:

    -   `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
    -   `app`: The main Express application imported from `./app`.
    -   `transactionsJob`: A function imported from `./crons/transactionsJob` that likely handles scheduled or recurring tasks related to transactions.
2.  Environment Configuration:

    -   `dotenv.config();`: This line loads the environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, making them accessible throughout the application.
3.  Transactions Job Initialization:

    -   A self-invoking asynchronous function is defined and immediately executed to start the `transactionsJob`. If an error occurs during its execution, it is caught and logged to the console.
4.  Server Initialization:

    -   The Express `app` listens on a port defined by the `PORT` environment variable. Upon successful listening, it logs a message indicating that the server is listening on the specified port.

This file primarily sets up and starts the server along with a job for handling transactions, all while ensuring that the necessary environment variables are loaded.

# app.ts

1.  Importing Modules and Initial Setup:

    typescript

    Copy code

    `import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction, Application } from 'express';
    import response from './middlewares/response/responseAppender';
    const app: Application = express();`

    -   `express`: This imports the express framework, which is essential for creating the server.
    -   `Request, Response, NextFunction, Application`: These are type imports from Express to help with typing of function parameters and the application instance.
    -   `response`: This imports a middleware function from `responseAppender` module, used to append data or modify the response.
    -   `app`: An instance of an Express application, used to configure the server.
2.  Middleware for Parsing JSON and URL-Encoded Request Bodies:

    typescript

    Copy code

    `// parse json request body
    app.use(express.json());

    // parse urlencoded request body
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`

    -   This sets up middleware in the Express app to parse JSON and URL-encoded request bodies. The `extended: true` option allows parsing of rich objects and arrays.
3.  Custom Middleware - `responseAppender`:

    typescript

    Copy code

    `// responseAppender
    async function responseAppender(req: any, res: any, next: any) {
      await response(req, res, next);
      next();
    }
    app.use(responseAppender);`

    -   A custom asynchronous middleware function that processes the request using another `response` middleware imported at the beginning. It ensures that the next middleware is called after its operation completes.
4.  404 Error Handling for Unknown API Requests:

    typescript

    Copy code

    `// send back a 404 error for any unknown api request
    app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      next(Error('Not found'));
    });`

    -   This middleware intercepts any requests that did not match previous routes or middleware and forwards a new error with the message 'Not found', which can be used by error handling middleware to send a 404 response.
5.  Exporting the Configured App:

    typescript

    Copy code

    `export default app;`

    -   The configured Express application is exported, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application, typically where the server is started.

This breakdown details how the application is structured and handles requests, providing insights into middleware usage and request handling in an Express.js application.
